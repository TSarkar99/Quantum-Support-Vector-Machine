# Quantum-Support-Vector-Machine
This repository contains the code for the Quantum Support Vector Machine that was implemented for the IBM India Challenge 2020. The feature maps used are custom feature map in the code, but the optimal result was obtained using an inbuilt feature map called Pauli feature map.
